# The Monkees - A responsive mobile first band website design.

## What is this?

This is a college project aimed at desiging a  responsive mobile first designed web application. The styling is that of a 60's era band. The project requested a means of contact for their fans, social media links, and to showcase their music online, along with being able to book the band for upcoming events.

## UX

Since the website was initially aimed at people of an older generation, large fonts with easy to navigate areas were chosen. Fans want to acces band media, and stay up to date via email or social media. What the band wants is to make themselves available to play to their fans. 

During the [wireframe mockup](https://imgur.com/a/rSrGeYD), I decided on a one page design. For the user, it means they never have to leave the page with everything they need on it. Each section rolls on to the next and with mobile centric design in mind, a button linking back to the home menu at the bottom of each section allows the user to get back to the menu at all times. This was a later addition made after testing.



## Features

#### Design
Rounded edges, a colour palette from the 60's with faded background image. These style choices make the website more familiar to older fans. 

#### Functionality
The website is a three page design. A primary page for all content, and two "thank you" pages linked to both forms. A "Back to Home" button sits at the bottom of each section linking back to the main menu. Form one is modal requesting and email address for a fan club signup. Form two is a booking form requesting a name, email and details regarding an event. Both forms work correctly.
